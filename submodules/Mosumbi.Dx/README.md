# Immense.RemoteControl
Client and server libraries for adding remote control functionality to existing .NET apps.

### Quick Start
See the projects under `/Examples/` for a demonstration on how to use the libraries.  For the client, there's a launch profile for both Attended and Unattended.  There's a multi-project startup config file in the solution dir, which is used by [SwitchStartupProject](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vs-publisher-141975.SwitchStartupProject), an extension that lets you easily switch startup projects. 

Documentation will come... some day.
